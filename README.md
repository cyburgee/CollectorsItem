Collector's Item
==============

The game is Collector’s Item. Your mouse is broken but that cannot stop you from adding to your collection.  Add the items to your shopping cart by launching your mouse at the “Add to Cart” button. You can send it forward by holding the mouse button and releasing it. The longer you hold, the stronger the thrust will be. Watch out, you might get your item but the packaging will get in your way.

Collector's Item is a prototype of a one button game about consumerism and the consequences of button presses for the Processing programming envirnoment.
The project was created for the Experimental Game Design class at Carnegie Mellon University.
